# Final-Project-Submission
The theme of this final project requires me to assess my personal and career goals as I navigate towards achieving my degree here at Chaminade University. In this paper, I will overview my thoughts about various questions with the theme of technology in the DS 100 Data Science Applications course. It can be found in the main branch of this repository under "DS 100-01-1 Final Project GitHub Submission".

Mahalo!
